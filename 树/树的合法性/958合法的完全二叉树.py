xample 1:



Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: true
Explanation: Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.
Example 2:



Input: [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
Output: false
Explanation: The node with value 7 isn't as far left as possible.
